## 📌 Key Insights

- **OnePlus** was the top-selling brand across all regions, while **Apple** generated the highest revenue.
- **Turkey** recorded the highest sales and revenue.
- **EMI** was the most commonly used payment method across all transactions.
- **September** saw a notable dip in total revenue, followed by a strong recovery in **October**.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Expand OnePlus distribution and partnerships** across all regions to capitalize on its popularity and consistent sales volume.
- **Strengthen Apple’s premium positioning** by bundling services, offering trade-in programs, or targeting high-income segments to maintain and grow its high-revenue contribution.
- **Double down on marketing and logistics efforts in Turkey**, as it is the strongest-performing market. Consider launching region-specific promotions or early product releases there.
- **Promote EMI-friendly offers and visibility**, since EMI is the preferred payment method. Collaborate with more financial partners to expand eligibility and simplify the process.
- **Investigate the revenue dip in September**, which may signal seasonality, operational issues, or ineffective campaigns. Use learnings to prepare preventive measures for future periods.
- **Replicate successful strategies from October** that contributed to the revenue rebound—such as promotions, new product launches, or marketing pushes—and apply them in other low-performing months.
